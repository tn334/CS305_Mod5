#This program is a GPA and Grade Calculator

#upon run, program requests input confirming which of the two calculators the user would like to use

#Program then asks user to decide to input data into the calculator

#after each input program asks if there is more to add
  #if yes program continues

#otherwise it will calculate and display calculations.

# Hypothetical module I, Sami Jurado, am adding to this project:
#nothing, really, except maybe adding a third calculator.
